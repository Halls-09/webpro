        <p>
        
The Nike Zoom Freak 3 Crimson Bliss was inspired by Giannis Antetokounmpo, a professional basketball player who plays for the Milwaukee Bucks in the NBA. 

The Crimson Bliss Nike Zoom Freak 3 has a predominantly crimson upper with turquoise, Melon Tint, and Thunder Blue accents. The upper of the shoe is made from a combination of durable synthetic materials and breathable mesh. The combination of materials ensures that the shoe is able to withstand the rigors of basketball while also providing comfort and support. The Nike Swoosh logo is featured on both sides of the shoe, with additional branding on the tongue, upper and heel tab. The collar is padded for additional comfort and support around the ankle, and the outsole is made from rubber and features a pattern, which provides grip on the court. 

The Nike Zoom Freak 3 Crimson Bliss was released on August 27, 2021 at a retail price of $120.
